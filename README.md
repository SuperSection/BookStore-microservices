## What is Microservice Architecture?

Microservices is an architecture style where large applications are composed of small services that provide specific business capabilities that can be deployed and managed independently.

### Pros of Microservices

- Easy to scale individual services as per requirement
- Easy to adopt newer technologies if needed
- Smaller codebases easy to understand & maintain
- Easier to migrate code of a service from one language to another
- Less dependency on other team deliverables

### Cons of Microservices

- Difficult to build & manage distributed systems
- Difficult to test & debug
- Complex deployment process
- Performance issues (e.g., high latency can cause slower response time)

## Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic architecture is a type of application design where all components, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layers, are tightly integrated into a single, inseparable unit. This means the entire application is developed, deployed, and managed as a single package.

### Pros of Monolithic Architecture

- Simpler Development
- Easier Testing & Debugging
- Simpler Deployment

### Cons of Monolithic Architecture

- Difficult to scale sub-systems (modules)
- Difficult to adopt new technologies
- Higher chance to become "big ball of mud" â€“ messy codebase & complex service communications
